# BIG BOND

## Run in a development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
NOTE: the first time running `ng serve` you will need to run `npm i` first. You may need to install npm if you haven't already.
## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component <component-name>` (or the shorthand `ng g c <component-name>` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Deploy
Use an FTP application like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) to transfer files to the hosting service. [This](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-deploy-web-apps-online-8d282e58ad88) is a helpful guide on deploying angular webapps on the hosting service bluehost.
