            <p class="main-txt" >
                Can I cook/grill at the campsite?
            </p> 
            Yes! Small, portable propane stoves/grills are allowed for cooking. 
            Tanks up to 4 lbs (per group) will be allowed into the campground. 
            Please monitor your cooking devices and fully turn off tanks whenever 
            you are not using them. Inhaling flamable gases is dangerous so keep these items away
            from enclosed spaces.
            Stay safe, and be aware of your surroundings while cooking. 
            Campfire cooking is also allowed within designated fire pits. Never use gasoline to 
            start a fire.
            
            <p class="main-txt">
                What comes with a campsite?
            </p>
            Campsites are included with your Big Bond wristband and the Big Bond 
            grounds have bathrooms and showers without potable water as well as fire pits. 
            Cars, RVs, Vans, and tent camping is allowed.
            
            <p class="main-txt" >
                Will there be a general store at the campsites?
            </p> 
            No, please bring all essentials. A cash only food truck may be available, but be prepared with all your own
            food. You are responsible for your own supplies. 
            Sadly Uber eats will not make it out to the camp grounds but there is a gas station and a few 
            restaurants within minutes.  
            <p class="main-txt" >
                How do I get to Big Bond?

            <p class="main-txt" >
                Can I leave the campsite and come back?
            </p>
            Yep! as long as you are still wearing your valid Big Bond wristband you will not be asked to leave and you may come
            and go as you please.
            <p class="main-txt" >
                Will I be able to camp by my car?
            </p>
            You may park and set up camp almost anywhere in the grounds. 
            Spots are given on a first come first serve basis.

            <p class="main-txt" >
                Do I need a 4 wheel drive vehicle?
            </p>
            Unless you drive a Ferrari, your vehicle will have no trouble.

            <p class="main-txt" >
                How does check-in work?
            </p>
            There are not assigned check-in times, but all attendees must arrive
            on Friday February 17th, 2023 between 4:00 PM and 7:00 PM. If you cannot arrive within
            the designated check-in window, please send Big Bond an email so organizers can plan accordingly.
            Please already be wearing your wristband when you arrive.
            Big Bond volunteers will be waiting at the gate to check wristbands and welcome you to Big Bond.
            <p class="main-txt">
                What is the difference between wristband tiers?
            </p>
            The only difference is the price, but a fixed number of wirstbands will be sold at each tier, so lock in 
            a lower price while you still can.
