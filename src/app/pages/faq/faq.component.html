                What comes with my wristband?
            </p>
            A wristband grants you entry and camping to the grounds of Big Bond, where you can immerse yourself into two days of camping, hiking, and music.
            <p class="main-txt" >
                Who needs a wristband?
            </p>    
            All attendees need a wristband.
            <p class="main-txt">
                Are tickets expected to sell out?
            </p>
            There is a limited number of wristbands so it is possible that they can sell out.
            Get your tickets now — we want to make sure you don’t miss out!
            <p class="main-txt" >
                When will I get my wristband?
            </p>  
            Wristbands will be shipped to the address provided at checkout. If you are buying a wristband after 
            the shipping deadline, show your order confirmation email at check-in to receive your wristband. 
            Please email info@bigbond.us if you need to update 
            your shipping address prior to the festival or if you have any questions.

            <p class="main-txt" >
                What if I lose my wristband?
            </p>
            Please take extra care to not lose your wristband as they are not replaceable.
            <p class="main-txt" >
                Are there refunds for wristbands?
            </p>  
            No, all sales are final for wristband purchases. 
            <p class="main-txt" >
                What are the festival hours?
            </p>  
            Check-in will begin the afternoon of Friday, April 26th. All attendees must fully pack up and leave no trace by noon
            on Sunday, April 28th. More detailed times for check-in are TBA. A full Big Bond schedule will also be coming soon.
            
            
            <p class="main-txt" >
                Can I cook/grill at the campsite?
            </p> 
            Yes! Small, portable propane stoves/grills are allowed for cooking. 
            Please monitor your cooking devices and fully turn off butane tanks whenever 
            you are not using them. Inhaling flamable gases is dangerous so keep these items away
            from enclosed spaces.
            Stay safe, and be aware of your surroundings while cooking. 
            Campfire cooking is also allowed within designated fire pits. Never use gasoline to 
            start a fire.
            
            <p class="main-txt">
                What comes with a campsite?
            </p>
            Campsites are included with your Big Bond wristband and the Big Bond 
            grounds have bathrooms and showers without potable water as well as fire pits. 
            Cars, RVs, Vans, and tent camping is allowed.
            
            <p class="main-txt" >
                Will there be a general store at the campsites?
            </p> 
            No, please bring all essentials. A cash only food truck may be available, but be prepared with all your own
            food. You are responsible for your own supplies. 
            Sadly Uber eats will not make it out to the camp grounds but there is a gas station and a few 
            restaurants within minutes.

                Can I leave the campsite and come back?
            </p>
            Yep! as long as you are still wearing your valid Big Bond wristband you will not be asked to leave and you may come
            and go as you please.

            <p class="main-txt" >
                Is it ok if I'm not planning on camping on the festival grounds?
            </p>
            Not a problem.
            It gets very dark at night, so driving around the festival grounds in the dark isn't allowed.
            However, there will be a designated parking area near the gate for attendees that 
            aren't camping at the festival. You can come and go from this parking area as you please.

            <p class="main-txt" >
                Will I be able to camp by my car?
            </p>
            You may park and set up camp almost anywhere in the grounds. 
            Spots are given on a first come first serve basis. 
            Please see the festival grounds map on the <a href="/directions">directions page.</a> 

            <p class="main-txt" >
                Is there festival map?
            </p>
            There is a map of the Big Bond grounds on the <a href="/directions">directions page.</a>
            Landmarks on the map are farther apart than they appear. Big Bond takes place on 640 acres
            of beautiful desert.

            <p class="main-txt" >
                Do I need a 4 wheel drive vehicle?
            </p>
            Unless you drive a Ferrari, your vehicle will have no trouble.

            <p class="main-txt" >
                How does check-in work?
            </p>
            There are not assigned check-in times. 2024 check-in date and time is TBA. If you cannot arrive within
            the designated check-in window, please send Big Bond an email so organizers can plan accordingly.
            Please already be wearing your wristband when you arrive.
            Big Bond volunteers will be waiting at the gate to check wristbands and welcome you to Big Bond.
            <p class="main-txt">
                What is the difference between wristband tiers?
            </p>
            The only difference is the price, but a fixed number of wirstbands will be sold at each tier, so lock in 
            a lower price while you still can.

            <p class="main-txt" >
                I want to check out the national park. What should I do?
            </p>
