                Are tickets expected to sell out?
            </p>
            There is a limited number of wristbands so it is possible that they can sell out.

                What if I lose my wristband?
            </p>
            Please take extra care to not lose your wristband as they are not replaceable.
            <p class="main-txt" >
                Are there refunds for wristbands?
            </p>

                What are the festival hours?

                Can I cook/grill at the campsite?
            </p> 
            Yes! Small, portable propane stoves/grills are allowed for cooking. 
            Tanks up to 4 lbs (per group) will be allowed into the campground. 
            Please monitor your cooking devices and fully turn off tanks whenever 
            you are not using them. Inhaling flamable gases is dangerous so keep these items away
            from enclosed spaces.
            Stay safe, and be aware of your surroundings while cooking. 
            Campfire cooking is also allowed within designated fire pits. Never use gasoline to 
            start a fire.
            
            <p class="main-txt" >
                Will there be a general store at the campsites?
            </p> 
            No, please bring all essentials. A cash only food truck may be available, but be prepared with all your own
            food. You are responsible for your own supplies. 
            Sadly Uber eats will not make it out to the camp grounds but there is a gas station and a few 
            restaurants within minutes.

                How do I get to Big Bond?
            </p> 
            Check out the <a href="/directions">Directions page.</a>
            
            <p class="main-txt" >
                Can I leave the campsite and come back?
            </p>
            Yep! as long as you are still wearing your valid Big Bond wristband you will not be asked to leave and you may come
            and go as you please.
            <p class="main-txt">
                What is the difference between wristband tiers?
            </p>
            The only difference is the price, but a fixed number of wirstbands will be sold at each tier, so lock in 
            a lower price while you still can.
