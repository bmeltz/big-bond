            A Tent, RV, or Vehicle with fold flat seats will work great. Sleeping bag,

            Recommended: 1.5 gallons of water per person per day at a minimum. It might seem like a lot, but water is one thing you definitely don't 
            want to be worring about. <br>
            Plan your meals. Recommended: hotdogs (don't forget skewers), sandwiches, and snacks. 
            Bring at least 1 cooler with ice, paper towels, foil, utensils, and firewood.
            Exercise caution working with camping stoves and campfires.

            ear plugs are great. Towel, bathroom essentials, first aid kit, sunglasses, bug spray, trash bags, flashlight, backpack, some cash, 
            chapstick, toilet paper, portable charger, and good vibes.
