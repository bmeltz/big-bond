            If your vehicle's seats fold down, throw down some blankets and a few pillows and you're set.
            A tent is another great option as long as you bring a sleeping bag and an inflatable sleeping pad.
            If camping really isn't your thing and you have friends and money to spend, RV rentals can be found at websites like 
            <a href="https://www.outdoorsy.com">outdorrsy.com</a> and <a href="https://www.cruiseamerica.com/">cruiseamerica.com</a>.
            We don't recommend hammocks as the only good place to string one up is between two vehicles.
            A folding chair or two are nice to have.
            <br><br>
            Depending on when you get on the road, you could end up having to set up camp in the dark which can be challenging for even the most experienced campers, so plan accordingly.

            <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:white; background-color:white;">
            What you decide to bring to eat is entirely up to you, but here's some advice if you don't know where to start.
            <br><br>
            Hotdogs are likely the easiest thing to cook when camping (don't forget skewers).
            If you plan on cooking over a campfire, bring your own firewood.
            It's the desert, so don't expect to find firewood at the campsite once you get there. Places like walmart and HEB usually sell bags of firewood.
            You might also want to bring some smaller sticks you find lying around to help the fire get started. You'll also need a lighter and something to get
            the fire going (dryer lint is a great option). Sandwiches are also a great option. Protein bars, bananas, and 
            peanut butter are good too.
            If you would rather not try to cook in the desert, look into dehydrated meals like <a href=" https://mountainhouse.com/">these</a>.
            Keep in mind that this option still requires you to boil water. You will want a good cooler and ice to keep your drinks and food cold.
            <br><br>
            It is also extremely important to bring enough water because <b style="text-decoration: underline;">There is no potable water at the campsite</b>. 
            We recommend 2 gallons per person per day. This may seem like a lot, but the only thing worse than feeling like you might run out of water is actually running out of water. 
            A large jug like
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reliance-Products-Aqua-Tainer-Gallon-Container/dp/B07S6JXCYJ/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=reliance+water+container&qid=1642273092&s=sporting-goods&sprefix=reliance+%2Csporting%2C103&sr=1-6">this one</a>
            is great.
