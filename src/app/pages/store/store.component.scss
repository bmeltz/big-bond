// not sure why mobile screens shift stuff right 8 pixels when desktop at the same screen size doesn't
// but they do.
// i think its a decent bet that desktop/laptop screens wont be used with widths below 740px, but its still hacky.
@media only screen and (max-width: 740px) {
    .frame-container{
        transform: translateX(-8px) !important;
    }
 }
